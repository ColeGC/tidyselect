## Resubmission

* The `Description:` field has been extended. References to the
  tidyverse are now in lower case. These are about the tidyverse in
  general and not the tidyverse package specifically.


## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci, R devel and R release)
* Windows (on R-hub)


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.


## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
